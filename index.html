      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from Appalachian State University, with a BS in Physics, trying to break into the software development world.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Greensboro, NC</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy making music, skating, snowboarding, running, and some video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be employed. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Greensboro, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I get to use some of the analytical skills I acquired in my physics background, but get to approach challenges with a little more creativity. I find this work more interesting than lab work, and less frustrating than being constrained by the laws of nature.</p>
